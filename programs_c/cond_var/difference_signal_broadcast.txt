1. **`pthread_cond_signal`:**
   - This function is used to signal one specific thread that is currently waiting on the associated condition variable.
   - If multiple threads are waiting, it is not specified which thread will be signaled. The decision is left to the implementation.
   - Use `pthread_cond_signal` when you expect that only one waiting thread needs to be notified about a change in the shared state.

   Example:
   ```c
   pthread_cond_signal(&condition_variable);
   ```

2. **`pthread_cond_broadcast`:**
   - This function is used to signal all threads that are currently waiting on the associated condition variable.
   - It ensures that all waiting threads are unblocked and can proceed with their execution.
   - Use `pthread_cond_broadcast` when you want to notify all waiting threads that a shared state has changed.

   Example:
   ```c
   pthread_cond_broadcast(&condition_variable);
   ```

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use `pthread_cond_signal` when only one waiting thread needs to be informed, and signaling multiple threads is unnecessary.
- Use `pthread_cond_broadcast` when multiple waiting threads need to be informed, and you want to wake them all up.

**Example:**
Consider a scenario where multiple threads are waiting for a shared resource to become available. If a thread releases the resource, it can use `pthread_cond_broadcast` to notify all waiting threads that the resource is now available for use by any of them. If `pthread_cond_signal` were used instead, only one of the waiting threads would be notified, and the rest would continue waiting.
